# My Blobs Project

This project generates and visualizes synthetic data using the `make_blobs` function from `sklearn` and applies a custom clustering algorithm to identify clusters in the data.

## Features

- Generates synthetic data with `make_blobs`.
- Implements a custom clustering algorithm using `pairwise_distances_argmin`.
- Visualizes the clustering results using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required packages. You can install the dependencies using:

```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
